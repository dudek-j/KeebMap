## About

Keebmap tries to help people find custom mechanical keyboard vendors in their region. It provides a searchable and filterable list of venords in a clean form factor. Visit the site at [keebmap.xyz/](https://keebmap.xyz/)

## Vendor requirements

The following requirements have to be fulfilled in order to for a vendor website to be qualified for being part of Keebmap: 

- Vendor should be focused on the custom mechanical keyboard hobby, i.e not a generic electronics store 
- Website should **not** only be focused on particular group buy run with limited availability 
- Vendor should carry at least one in stock item related to the mechanical keyboard hobby 

The goal of these requirements is to keep the list useful and make it so the users don't have to click through a bunch of irrelevant links.
