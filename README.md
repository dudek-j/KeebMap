## About

Keebmap tries to help people find custom mechanical keyboard vendors in their region. It provides a searchable and filterable list of venords in a clean form factor. Visit the site at [keebmap.xyz](https://keebmap.xyz)

## Contributing

If you want to propose changes to the vendor list, but are not comfortable with the Github tool, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AxSjtYAHun) and make your proposal in the dedicated channel. However, you will have to wait for a developer to integrate your proposal.
